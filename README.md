# Finding the minimum variance portfolio using LASSO regularization revisited using developing countries’ data

This project was conducted in the course of my seminar in the University of Tübingen's Master Seminar in Econometrics. The goal was to use the Lasso's property to shrink certain weights, in this application asset weights, to obtain a sparser portfolio than unregularized minimum variance portfolios would suggest. Sparser portfolios are easier to keep track off and feature lower transaction costs, making them also attractive for investors with a low budget.
The research paper discussing this topic in detail can be found in this repo (paper.pdf). If the reader is interested, my Python code that was used to implement this solution can also be found in the src folder.
